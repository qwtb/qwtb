function w = tukeywin(m, r)
% definition changed because of matlab compatibilty:
% function w = tukeywin(m, r=1/2)
% -- Function File: tukeywin (M)
% -- Function File: tukeywin (M, R)
%     Return the filter coefficients of a Tukey window (also known as the
%     cosine-tapered window) of length M.  R defines the ratio between
%     the constant section and and the cosine section.  It has to be
%     between 0 and 1.  The function returns a Hanning window for R equal
%     to 0 and a full box for R equals to 1.  The default value of R is
%     1/2.
%
%     For a definition of the Tukey window, see e.g.  Fredric J. Harris,
%     "On the Use of Windows for Harmonic Analysis with the Discrete
%     Fourier Transform, Proceedings of the IEEE", Vol.  66, No.  1,
%     January 1978, Page 67, Equation 38.
